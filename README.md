Data Analysis on HR Data


Welcome to the HR Data Report, where we leverage SQL for data analysis for Attrition in an organization and Power BI and Excel for creating interactive visualizations. 

HR Department is responsible for monitoring and managing various aspects of employee data to ensure the organization maintains a healthy workforce.There is a lack of clear performance indicators to track and analyze key HR metrics. Therefore, there is a need to design and implement a set of KPi's to address the following points.

	4.Active employees:
 The organization lacks a mechanism to differentiate between active and inactive employees, leading to difficulties in accurately assessing the current workforce's productivity and capacity.
